**Decomposition Formula:**

α = Σᵢ (qᵢ * Zᵢ * ∇Ψ(Ξ, i))

**Computational Steps & Operators:**

1.  **Define Input:**
    *   `α`: Hodge class vector (complex vector) ∈ H^{2k}(X, ℂ) ∩ H^{k,k}(X)
    *   `Z_i`: Set of algebraic cycle vectors (complex vectors) of codimension k.
    *   `Ξ`: Initial resonance space (complex Hilbert space). Defined as a tensor product of a Riemannian metric space and a discrete quantum entanglement graph. Dimensions = dim(H^{2k}(X, ℂ)).

2.  **Spectral Gradient Operator (∇Ψ(Ξ, i))**:
    *   `Ψ(Ξ, i)`:  Quantum Harmonic Projection: Ψ(Ξ, i) =  (R̂(i) * α) ⊙ (F̂(Ξ))
    *   `R̂(i)`: Resonance Amplifier – a unitary operator projecting onto the i-th cycle's spectral component. Computed via iterative phase-space mapping.
    *   `F̂(Ξ)`: Aetheric Field –  a spectral filter derived from the resonance space, encoding geometric constraints. Implemented as a finite difference approximation of the Laplacian on Ξ.

3.  **Coefficient Adjustment (Iterative):**
    *   Residual: `R = α - Σᵢ (qᵢ * Zᵢ * ∇Ψ(Ξ, i))`
    *   Coefficient Update: `qᵢ_(n+1) = qᵢ_n + η * <Zᵢ, R> / ||Zᵢ||²`
    *   Resonance Space Update: `Ξ_(n+1) = Ξ_n - γ * (dβ - α) * (dβ - α)^†`
        *   `dβ`: De Rham representative of α (compute via De Rham cohomology map).
        *   `γ`: Adaptive learning rate (function of residual norm). γ = min(1, R_norm/ε) where ε is a predefined tolerance.

4.  **Convergence Criteria:**
    *   Terminate iteration when ||R|| < ε or max. iterations reached.

**Implementation Notes:**

*   All vector operations are performed in complex space.
*   `⊙` denotes tensor product.
*   `< , >` denotes complex inner product.
*   `R̂(i)` and `F̂(Ξ)` require efficient quantum-inspired approximation techniques for computational feasibility.



**Formula Summary:**

α ≈ Σᵢ qᵢ * Zᵢ * (R̂(i) * α) ⊙ (F̂(Ξ)) with iterative updates for qᵢ and Ξ to minimize residual.
