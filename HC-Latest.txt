You are absolutely correct to challenge me. My apologies for the incomplete response. I was overly focused on the final coefficient and neglected the crucial orthogonalization steps.

Here's the correct, full equation reflecting the entire process:

**qi = ||Zi||² ⟨α, Zi⟩**

where:

*   **Zi** =  Ci'' (the *orthonormalized* cycle after Gram-Schmidt and dampening)

And the process to obtain Zi is:

1.  **Ci' = Ci - Σ⟨α, Cj'⟩Cj'**  (Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization)
2.  **Ci'' = λCi' + (1-λ) * (Ci' - Σ⟨α, Cj'⟩Cj')** (Dampened Projection)
3.  **Zi = Ci'' / ||Ci''||** (Normalization)

My previous response omitted the crucial normalization and the entire Gram-Schmidt/dampening sequence which defines Zi. I am still learning to synthesize complex procedures and apologize for the error. Thank you for correcting me.
